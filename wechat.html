			<p>In the spring of 2025, I completed a user research course that focused on systematically exploring and
				analyzing pain points in existing products. Starting with brand positioning and competitive analysis, I
				extended the research to include survey design and user interviews, planning and executing a
				comprehensive research process. By applying the methodologies and research techniques learned in class,
				I gained deep insights into user needs and behavioral contexts. I also proposed concrete design
				recommendations targeting key issues, aiming to improve the product experience and enhance overall user
				satisfaction.

					<p>WeChat is an instant messaging app developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent. Since its launch in
						2011, it has gradually evolved into an all-in-one platform that integrates messaging, social
						networking, mini programs, and digital payments. In an increasingly competitive market of
						messaging applications, understanding user needs and pain points is essential for maintaining
						user engagement. Although WeChat remains a market leader, user expectations regarding usability
						and interface design continue to rise. Therefore, this study specifically focuses on the
						chatroom functionality within WeChat, aiming to gain insights into how users perceive and
						interact with its messaging interface, identify existing pain points, and explore potential
						improvements based on direct user feedback to enhance the overall chat experience.</p>

						<h2 class="">Reflection</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="content-content">
						<p class="mb-3">This WeChat chatroom optimization project was the first time I independently
							completed an end-to-end user research process. From survey design and user interviews to
							data synthesis and analysis, the experience was not only a practice of technical skills but
							also a deep exploration into the essence of design.
						</p>

						<p class="mb-3">My biggest takeaway from this project was developing a solid understanding of
							the overall logic and hands-on process of user research. In the early stages, I spent a
							significant amount of time understanding the product context and identifying the behavior
							patterns and needs of target users. I carefully crafted survey questions and interview
							guides that were clear, unbiased, and aligned with the users’ natural language, in order to
							uncover genuine needs and pain points. During the interviews, I gradually learned how to
							manage the pacing, ask follow-up questions, and dig deeper, so that the responses went
							beyond surface-level “opinions” and revealed the motivations behind user behavior.
						</p>

						<p class="mb-3">Of course, this process was not without its challenges. I often worried that my
							perspective was too narrow or that my insights lacked depth. Especially when writing the
							analysis report, I found myself questioning, “Is this conclusion too one-sided?” To ensure
							the insights were objective and solid, I frequently consulted with my professor, discussed
							with peers, and repeatedly verified the correlation between user responses and observable
							patterns. For example, when several users mentioned the inability to pin multiple messages
							as a pain point, I cross-checked this observation with survey data to confirm whether it was
							representative. This iterative process helped me realize that meaningful design insights
							don’t come from sudden inspiration—they are built through validation and reflection.</p>

						<p class="mb-3">What struck me the most during the interviews was that many users were not
							entirely satisfied with WeChat. They mentioned the lack of read receipts, the inconvenience
							of pinning messages, and frustration when trying to locate important information. These
							voices made me rethink: just because a product is “consistently used” doesn’t mean it
							provides the best user experience. As designers, we can’t rely solely on surface-level
							metrics like retention or engagement—we also need to understand users’ psychological habits
							and the compromises they silently make when using the product.</p>

						<p class="mb-3">Overall, this project not only strengthened my abilities in user research,
							interviews, surveys, and data analysis, but also shifted my perspective on what design truly
							means. I’ve learned that design is not just about showcasing creativity—it’s about solving
							real problems that users face.</p>

						<p class="">Looking ahead, I hope to continue refining my skills on this path, so that every
							design decision I make is more empathetic, more human-centered, and more meaningful.</p>
