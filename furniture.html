			<p>In the spring of 2025, I completed an interaction design course focused on brand positioning, target
				audience analysis, and strategic approaches to digital product design. Throughout the semester, our main
				project was to redesign an existing website using the methods and techniques learned in class. The goal
				was to create an innovative solution that effectively communicates the brand’s value, enhances user
				experience, and supports the client’s business objectives.

					<p>Jerusalem Furniture is a furniture store offering a wide selection of pieces ranging from classic
						to contemporary styles. It provides furniture for every living space, including bedroom sets,

				<div class="content-content">
					<div class="mb-10">
						<p class="mb-3">The current website suffers from disorganized design and poor content layout
							strategies,
							which confuse visitors, reduce trust in the brand, and risk losing potential customers. Key
							issues include:</p>
						<ul class="mb-3">
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Unstrategic Navigation: </span>
								As an e-commerce website, the navigation structure plays a crucial role. However,
								content with low relevance to online shopping is placed in prominent positions, instead
								of being moved to secondary areas where it would be more appropriate.
							</li>
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Unengaging Banners and Promotional Content: </span>The
								hero section lacks banners related to featured products or current promotions. Although
								the site emphasizes financing options for furniture purchases, the content appears rigid
								and overly direct—failing to capture users’ attention or drive engagement, resulting in
								missed conversion opportunities.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="images/06/06-3.jpg" alt="">
					</div>

					<div class="mb-10">
						<ul class="mb-3">
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Product Page: </span>There is no proper
								product browsing
								page—only catalogs are available for preview. This results in a poor user experience, as
								visitors cannot accurately view product details or compare furniture items with others.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="images/06/06-4.jpg" alt="">
					</div>

					<div class="mb-10">
						<ul class="mb-3">
							<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Lack of Clear Explanation for Key Selling
									Point: </span>The original website highlights financing support as a main feature,
								but fails to provide detailed information on how it works. On the relevant page, there
								are no clear instructions or descriptions, leaving potential customers unsure about how
								to proceed with a purchase. This may result in lost sales, even among users who are
								already interested in buying.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="images/06/06-5.jpg" alt="">
					</div>

					<div class="">
						<p class="mb-3">Additional problems can be found throughout the website in areas such as visual
							layout, content structure, and overall usability—for example, the “Contact Us” page,
							shopping cart, and member-related features all present various user experience challenges.
							Therefore, addressing the above pain points is essential not only to improve the overall
							user experience, but also to better support the site’s business goals.</p>

						<p class="mb-3">Linda Halimi, a 52-year-old “savvy budgeter,” represents the brand’s most
							important customer segment. She is a married part-time administrative assistant living in
							the suburbs of Boston. With moderate tech literacy, she primarily gathers shopping
							information through Facebook and Google. Linda cares deeply about her family’s quality of
							life and serves as the main decision-maker for household budgeting and purchases. She
							believes that furniture doesn’t have to be expensive — as long as it’s durable, stylish, and
							affordable, it’s a good choice.</p>
						<img src="images/06/06-7.jpg" alt="">
					</div>

					<div class="">
						<p class="mb-3">The accompanying customer journey map uses Linda’s real-life experience of
							purchasing a dining table and chair set to illustrate the full process from initial need to
							final purchase decision. The research identified several key pain points: confusing website
							navigation, unclear product information, insufficient explanation of installment payment
							options, and a lack of effective product comparison features. Linda’s core needs include
							clear product presentation, transparent installment payment details, a simplified shopping
							process, and a sense of security when making a purchase.</p>

						<img src="images/06/06-12.jpg" alt="" class="">
						<p>I chose Garamond as the heading typeface because it conveys a sense of elegance and
							timelessness. Its classic serif style adds a touch of sophistication and trustworthiness to
							the brand, which aligns well with the image of a quality furniture company. The refined
							letterforms help elevate the visual tone and create a strong first impression, especially
							when highlighting the brand story or key messages.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="">
						<img src="images/06/06-13.jpg" alt="" class="">
						<p>Proxima Nova is used for body text due to its clean, modern, and highly legible design. It
							strikes a balance between geometric precision and a friendly, approachable feel, making it
							ideal for displaying product information and content-heavy sections. This font reflects the
							brand’s positioning—affordable yet stylish—and ensures that users can comfortably read and
							engage with the content across various devices.</p>

					<p>A clean and simple homepage design helps visitors quickly find the products they’re looking for.

						visitors into customers.</p>

			<div class="mb-10">
				<ol>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Nav Bar
							: </span><br>Main Nav: Organize the products into categories so that visitors can quickly
						find
						what they’re looking for.<br>
						Secondary Nav: Use smaller and lighter text for the secondary navigation to differentiate it
						from the primary navigation.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Main Nav:
						</span> Use storytelling slogans on the banners. Different banners should feature different
						slogans to attract various target audiences.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Product Categories:
						</span> Both the banner and the overall layout follow an F-shaped reading pattern. This design
						aligns with how most users read web pages, helping catch their attention quickly. The product
						categories are high-level groupings. I chose warm and harmonious tones for the photos here to
						reflect the brand’s spirit. If there are subcategories, a number is shown for clarity.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Call to Action:
						</span> “Want to design your room?” This is a CTA encouraging users to download the app. By
						doing so, they can use AR to visualize how Jerusalem Furniture pieces
						would look in their space. The image is enlarged to highlight where to access this service.
						Since part of the target audience is middle-aged users, this design
						aims to catch their attention and lead them to download the app. Clicking on it will take them
						directly to the store page.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">The highlight of the brand spirit 1:
						</span> Allowing users to quickly browse different categories of sale items, making the
						experience more user-friendly. Product info includes buyer ratings. This feature
						helps grab attention, especially if the product has good reviews.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">The highlight of the brand spirit 2:
						</span> I used relevant images in the finance aid section. The original website emphasizes
						stress-free furniture shopping, thanks to installment options through their
						finance aid partner. So I chose images that reinforce this collaboration. As mentioned above,
						this is an important section. I think it’s necessary to clearly show
						users the different ways they can apply for finance aid. It helps them realize that buying
						furniture from Jerusalem Furniture can be a relaxed experience.
					</li>
					<li><span class="font-weight-bold">Footer:
						</span> The footer navigation is less important than the header nav, so I placed it at the
						bottom. I organized it clearly in list form, making it easier for users to find
						what they need.

						<h2 class="" style="color: #fff;">Reflection</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="content-content">
						<p class="mb-3" style="color: #fff;">Redesigning the website for Jerusalem Furniture was not just about modernizing
							the brand’s
							visual identity — more importantly, it was about improving the site’s ability to drive
							online sales. This led me to ask: in an industry where physical experience remains a key
							differentiator, how can digital UX become a meaningful bridge between brand and customer?
						</p>

						<p class="mb-3" style="color: #fff;">Through research, I discovered that the original site lacked a strategic
							navigation
							structure. Key information was buried under complex categories, leaving users feeling lost
							during product discovery. Additionally, financing options — a highly appealing factor for
							many customers — were not clearly communicated. This made me reconsider whether the current
							design truly addressed real user concerns.
						</p>

						<p class="mb-3" style="color: #fff;">One of the biggest challenges came from designing for three distinctly different
							user groups:
							budget-conscious middle-aged families, newlyweds or small households, and younger renters
							who prioritize aesthetics. To better understand their behaviors and pain points, I created
							detailed personas and customer journey maps. This process helped me turn abstract insights
							into actionable design strategies and deepened my belief that design is not just about how
							things look — it’s about making intentional, strategic choices.</p>

						<p class="mb-3" style="color: #fff;">This project also taught me to consider financing options as a core part of the
							e-commerce
							experience. From content hierarchy and visual cues to interaction flow, every detail had to
							clearly convey value in a limited space. I learned how to simplify complex information and
							present it in a way that feels intuitive and trustworthy.</p>

						<p class="mb-3" style="color: #fff;">Looking back, the most valuable part of this project was learning how to
							integrate diverse
							needs and support the client in aligning design with business goals. If given the chance to
							iterate further, I’d love to enhance the product comparison feature and improve the search
							experience — helping users make decisions faster and turning the website into a true digital
							storefront.</p>

						<p class="" style="color: #fff;">This journey reminded me that great design isn’t just beautiful — it’s
							understandable,
							trustworthy, and ultimately, actionable.</p>
